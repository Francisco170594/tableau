## Results

### Trips by Weekday (Hour)
Mos people go for a ride early in the morning (5am - 10am) or during the evenings. So we suggest that picking bikes up for maintenance to be performed in the first hours of the day (12am - 4am)

### Trips by gender
Again, both genders folow a similar patterns when using bike share services, but, not in the same proportion: it's close toa 3:1 ratio.

### Trips by gender by weekday
The day most costumers ride is saturday, on the other hand suscribers really like to get a bike on thursdays. We could use this to display specific marketing campaings depending on wich day it is and who is more likely to be on the spot.
