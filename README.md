# Tableau

## oVERVIEW
Turning our sight at the mythic city of New York, we will evaluate the NYC citybike share program, as we take a closer look at it's pieces we'll use this information to bring insights on how a similar 
businees can be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. 
Once our analysis is completed we'll present this idea to potential investors, showing them key aspects of a thriving industry.

## Results

### Check out times for users
Most of the trips last around 10 minutes, even though the time frame for rides goes from 30 (costumers) to 45 (suscribers) minutes.  

###Check out times by gender
Man and women show similar behaviour when they take a trip. During weekends, riding activity is spread out through out the afternoon. 

### Trips by Weekday (Hour)
Most people go for a ride early in the morning (5am - 10am) or during the evenings.  We suggest to pick bikes up for maintenance to be performed in the first hours of the day (12am - 4am)

### Trips by gender
Again, both genders follow similar patterns when using bike share services, but, not in the same proportion: it's close to a 3:1 ratio.

### Trips by gender by weekday
The day most costumers ride is Saturday, on the other hand, subscribers seem to like taking a trip on Thursdays. We could use this to display specific marketing campaigns depending on which day it is and who is more likely to be on the spot.

### Bike utilization
To make the maintenance program efficient, we could track both the time and distance a bike travels from one station to another, to determine wich need checkups or repairs. A bar code system allows keeping inventory and track the location on each bike.

### Top starting locations
Deciding the number and locations of stations per bloc/neighborhood, it's entirely related to the traffic of people in a respective area, wich is connected to the presence of parks, schools, museums, all kinds 
of business, markets and so on. 
All these landmarks are to be considered.

### Number of trips by age
People in their fifties, probably retired or soon to be, are, by far, the biggest users of this service. The second largest age group is people in their thirties, but from this point, a decline in check out time is seen. Are they too busy with work, family, and friends? Maybe, thus presenting our service in a way you could enjoy with family or just to relax and appreciate the city could lead to good results 



## Summary

Most trips lasted around 10 minutes, even though users can take up to 45 minutes trips. Sticking to this time lapse seems a good way to start the business.

50 year old men are the biggest users, but the majority of them are not suscribers. 
Suscribers had more check outs on thursdays, whereas costumers had more activity on saturdays.
Men and women ride citybikes in a smilar way, but men are the biggest segment of the population.
During the week, a good amount of affluence is seen in the morning and evening. On weekends, an evenly amount of trips are taken during the afternoon
Age group 15 - 20 has litttle interest in traveling the city with the NYC program. 

Recording user's habits, helps us understand their behaviour around our service, wich leads to delimiting advertisement to a certain age group, time of the day, day of the week, etc. And also, it allows us to always be ready with enough bikes on each station to supply the demand.

### Other possible visualizations
After studying the affluence of tourist in different parts of the city, we can decide on the capacity and size of each bike station.

Providing a map to the costumer with safe and bike-suitable routes is a matter of atention to detail. Searching data regarding car and/or bicycle accidents in Des Moines, could help us see this through.

Adidtional suggestions for the city council on traffic signals and/or lights could be advised

If we go further we could see areas in the city, were there would be potential subscribers (determined by the age group with more activity) and advertise to them.


### A note for the future
We want this service to be always on demand, not only on vacations. Applying discounts for students, adding stations or sightings more focused on the locals, wich includes places or buildings that represent
definitive moments in it's history. Somewhat like the Berlin Wall.That wall represented fear, and how different perspectives could lead to the exclusion of indviduals by their own peers. And now, in a free 
Germany, it serves as a main atraction for tourist. Maybe Des Moines doesn't have anything like that, but there's gotta be a story we can tell the people.
